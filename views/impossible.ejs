        <p>What's an impossible list, you ask? It's a concept that I got from Thomas Frank, of <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com">College Info Geek</a> fame. (Thomas's impossible list is <a href="https://collegeinfogeek.com/about/meet-the-author/my-impossible-list/">here</a>.)</p>

        <p>He, in turn, got the concept from Joel Runyon, who created the <a href="https://impossiblehq.com/impossible-list/">world's first impossible list</a> (to my knowledge, at least).</p>

        <p>Basically, an impossible list is a list of things that you want to do before you die. However, it's distinct from a bucket list in that an impossible list is iterative and measurable. To steal a quote from Thomas Frank, "Put simply, the impossible list is an ever-evolving list of experiences that build upon each other, help others as well as yourself, and implore you to take action."</p>
